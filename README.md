# Burger App
An app to track burgers to eat. The data is stored in the app's SQL database (run through JawsDB on Heroku). This app is a practice in using SQL queries on a hosted web application.

The app allows users to submit burger names, and see those burgers appear in the browser in a list. Users can then click the button accompanying each burger name to "eat" that burger, moving it from the list of uneaten burgers to the list of eaten burgers. The database entry for that burger is updated to reflect its eaten status.
